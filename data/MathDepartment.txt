knowledge of basic processes. This course concentrates
on mathematics that can be applied to contexts related as
far as possible to other subjects being studied, to common
real-world occurrences and to topics that relate to home,
work, and leisure situations. The course requires students
to produce a project, a piece of written work based on
personal research, guided and supervised by the teacher. The
project provides an opportunity for students to carry out a
mathematical investigation in the context of another course
being studied, a hobby or an area of interest of their choice
using skills learned before and during the course. Students
